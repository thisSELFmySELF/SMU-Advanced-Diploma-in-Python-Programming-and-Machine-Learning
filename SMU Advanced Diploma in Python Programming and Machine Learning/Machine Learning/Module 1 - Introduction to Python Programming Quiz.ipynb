This “very good performance” means Singapore has exceeded the S$8 billion to S$10 billion which had been projected for the whole of 2020. These investments, in sectors including electronics and infocomm, will generate “a few thousand jobs” for workers in Singapore in the coming years, Mr Chan told reporters during a media briefing on Saturday (May 30). Companies such as chipmaker Micron and life sciences firm Thermo Fisher Scientific are adding jobs, he said.\"\n",

There are contractual issues that will have to be ironed out and studies to be done to help make the final assessment, he said. When asked by the media during an interview held via video-conferencing platform Zoom if he could confirm whether the annual F1 race would be held this year, Mr Chan said discussions are ongoing, and that an announcement will be made in the coming week.\"\n",

Singapore is also having such discussions with New Zealand and Malaysia, while China on Friday became the first country to establish a green lane with the Republic. Mr Chan said Singapore is in simultaneous discussions with “as many countries as possible” on forming green lanes, and that such discussions are taking place on a bilateral level, not a multilateral one. “We are happy that we have been able to swiftly work on arrangements with China, and we hope to make progress with the rest of the countries,” he said. Such arrangements allow for the restoration of connectivity and facilitation of short-term essential business and official travel between countries, subject to safeguards against the coronavirus.\"\n",
    "para4 = \"The Elections Department (ELD) cannot “prematurely” announce the rules and regulations relating to the next General Election as these may be overtaken by “events”, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said on Saturday (May 30). Speaking at a media briefing, he said: “ELD is fully aware of the competing needs. On one hand, ELD would like to make available the information to the parties and the candidates as early as possible for them to make the preparations. On the other hand, ELD has to work under the challenging constraint that there are many scenarios.” This comes after the Workers' Party had on Thursday called on the Government to “publish election campaign rules forthwith”, asking for more clarity on how campaigning might be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore's next General Election must be held by Apr 14, 2021.\"\n",
    "para5 = \"Just six months ago, South Korean pop darling IU belted out her hits to a packed hall at The Star Theatre over two days. But with the coronavirus, such days of sell-out K-pop concerts are over, at least for a while, possibly rendering concert organisers dispensable. Live shows have been banned around the world to curb the Covid-19 outbreak, and many entertainers have moved to streaming their performances online. Recently, German football league Bundesliga returned to action with games played in empty stadiums and live streamed to fans. Citing these developments, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the entertainment industry is among those that will require a new business model as the pandemic refashions the economy. “Fundamentally, the demand has changed, and perhaps people's way of life also is going to change,” said Mr Chan, as he outlined the sectors that Singapore should invest in and attract, as well as those that need to change.\"\n"
